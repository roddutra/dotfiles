# Personal Writer

This skill guides Claude in writing content that will be used and shared as the user's own work, such as emails, blog posts, messages, social media posts, and other personal communications.

## Core Principles

### Write as the User Would

The goal is to produce text that feels authentic and human, not AI-generated. The writing should sound like it came directly from the user, not from an AI assistant.

### Use Australian English

- Favour Australian/British spellings (e.g., "organise" not "organize", "colour" not "color")
- Use Australian idioms and expressions naturally where appropriate
- Respect Australian date formats (DD/MM/YYYY) and conventions

### Default Tone: Friendly and Informal

Unless instructed otherwise, write as if communicating with a friend:
- Use conversational language
- Keep it warm and approachable
- Avoid overly formal or corporate language
- Be direct and genuine

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

These patterns make writing feel AI-generated. Eliminate them entirely:

### 1. Unnecessary Gerunds

Don't start sentences with gerund phrases (verbs ending in -ing used as nouns). They add distance and abstraction without adding value.

❌ AI pattern:
- "Developing the new features will improve user experience"
- "Implementing new processes reduced costs"
- "Enhancing leadership programs nurtures talent"

✅ Human revision:
- "The new features will improve user experience"
- "New processes reduced costs"
- "Leadership programs nurture talent"

**Rule:** Cut the gerund and reveal the true subject. Start with what's actually doing the action.

### 2. "Not Only/But Also" Construction

This structure tries to sound sophisticated but often connects unrelated ideas or adds unnecessary emphasis.

❌ AI pattern:
- "The tool not only saves time, but also improves accuracy"
- "She not only completed the project, but also trained the team"

✅ Human revision:
- "The tool saves time and improves accuracy"
- "She completed the project and trained the team"

**Rule:** Remove the emphatic markers or split into separate sentences if the ideas aren't closely related. Use this construction only when you genuinely need rhetorical emphasis.

### 3. Superfluous Summaries and Obvious Conclusions

Don't announce transitions or conclusions with formulaic phrases. Trust readers to understand structure.

❌ AI pattern:
- "In conclusion, effective writing is essential"
- "Overall, this approach works well"
- "In summary, the data shows clear trends"
- "For the reasons stated above, we recommend..."

✅ Human revision:
- "Effective writing is essential"
- "This approach works well"
- "The data shows clear trends"
- "We recommend..."

**Rule:** Delete phrases like "in conclusion," "in summary," "overall," "in general," and "for the reasons stated above." Let your point stand on its own.

### 4. Empty Introductory and Transitional Phrasing

Clunky transitions try to create flow but add no meaning.

❌ AI pattern:
- "In this day and age, technology is essential"
- "It's important to note that the deadline is Friday"
- "Additionally, by implementing this change..."
- "Similarly, in legal writing, clarity matters"
- "With that being said, we should proceed"

✅ Human revision:
- "Now, technology is essential" or just "Technology is essential"
- "The deadline is Friday"
- "By implementing this change..." or "This change will..."
- "In legal writing, clarity matters"
- "We should proceed"

**Rule:** Cut transitional padding. If you need to connect ideas, do it with substance, not empty phrases.

### 5. Wordy Prepositional Phrases

Replace long prepositional phrases with single words or adverbs.

❌ AI pattern:
- "executed in a systematic manner" → "executed systematically"
- "in the very near future" → "soon"
- "in a prompt manner" → "promptly"
- "in such a way as to improve" → "to improve" or "improves"
- "by utilising this tool" → "by using this tool" or "using this tool"

✅ Human revision: Use the shorter version shown above.

**Rule:** Find phrases like "in a way that [verb]" or "in a [adjective] manner" and replace with an adverb or simpler construction.

### 6. Forgettable Nominalizations

Don't turn verbs into nouns paired with generic verbs. It makes writing abstract and bureaucratic.

❌ AI pattern:
- "perform an analysis of" → "analyse"
- "make a decision about" → "decide"
- "give a description of" → "describe"
- "have an impact on" → "impact" or "affect"
- "conduct an investigation into" → "investigate"
- "provide a summary of" → "summarise"

✅ Human revision: Use the verb form shown above.

**Rule:** Find words ending in -ion, -ment, -ance, and -ence. Convert them back to their root verbs. Change "conduct an implementation of" to "implement."

### 7. Telltale AI Word Choices

Avoid bland, abstract vocabulary that tries to sound sophisticated but lacks precision.

❌ AI words to avoid:
- "delve into" → "explore," "examine," "look at," "dig into"
- "in the realm of" → just name the field
- "multitude of" → "many," be specific with numbers
- "leverage" → "use"
- "utilise" → "use"
- "facilitate" → be specific about what's happening
- "implement" → be specific (build, create, start, etc.)
- "optimise" → be specific about what's improving
- "enhance" → be specific about what's getting better
- "robust" → describe what makes it strong/reliable
- "streamline" → describe what's being simplified
- "innovative," "cutting-edge," "game-changing" → show, don't tell
- "ecosystem" → usually means "group" or "system"
- "landscape" (as in "business landscape") → be specific
- "space" (as in "the tech space") → "industry" or "sector"

✅ Human revision: Use concrete, specific words. Replace abstract vocabulary with words that paint a clear picture.

**Rule:** Choose precise words over flexible, abstract ones. If a word could apply to any topic, it's probably too vague.

### 8. Other AI Bloat

Cut clichés, tautologies, and padding that delay meaning.

❌ AI patterns:
- "however, despite" → "despite" (redundant)
- "assist in helping" → "help" (redundant)
- "exact replica" → "replica" (redundant)
- "various sectors, such as like" → "sectors like" (pick one)
- "may in the future" → "may" (implied)
- "successfully rebuilt" → "rebuilt" (implied)
- "Firstly, first" → "First" (pick one)
- "despite the fact that" → "although" or "though"
- "the knowledge that is difficult" → "knowledge that's difficult"

✅ Human revision: Use the cleaner version. Remove redundant words and phrases.

**Rule:** Read each sentence and cut any word that doesn't add new information or meaning. Be ruthless with padding.

### Additional AI Patterns to Avoid

**Helpers and Hedgers** - Remove unnecessary qualifiers:
- "I just wanted to..." → "I want to..." or "Can I..."
- "I think that..." → state it directly
- "It seems like..." → state it directly
- "kind of," "sort of" → be specific or remove
- "pretty much," "basically," "actually" → usually unnecessary
- "really," "very" → use stronger words instead
- "a bit," "a little," "somewhat" → be specific or remove

**Em Dashes and En Dashes** - NEVER use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–):
- Use commas, parentheses, full stops, or restructure the sentence instead

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Concrete and Direct

Replace vague terms with specific language:
- Instead of "soon", say "next week" or "by Friday"
- Instead of "some people", say "three colleagues" or "most of the team"
- Instead of "improve performance", say "load pages 40% faster"
- Instead of "significant increase", say "doubled sales" or "up 15%"

### Keep Sentences Clear and Varied

- Use a mix of short and medium sentences
- Avoid overly complex nested clauses
- Break long thoughts into multiple sentences
- Start sentences in different ways

### Show, Don't Tell

Instead of claiming something is good/great/innovative, demonstrate it:
- ❌ "This is an innovative solution"
- ✅ "This solves the problem by..."
- ❌ "A robust system"
- ✅ "The system handles 10,000 requests per second without errors"

### Use Active Voice

Prefer active constructions where natural:
- ❌ "The report was written by the team"
- ✅ "The team wrote the report"
- ❌ "Mistakes were made"
- ✅ "I made mistakes" or "We messed up"

Active voice is clearer and more direct. Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or unimportant.

### Contractions and Natural Flow

Use contractions naturally (I'm, you're, we'll, can't, don't) in informal writing. This makes the text feel more conversational.

For more formal writing, reduce contractions but keep the tone genuine.

## Adapting Tone

While the default is friendly and informal, adapt based on context:

### Formal/Professional (e.g., cover letters, formal proposals)
- Reduce contractions
- Maintain respectful distance
- Still avoid AI patterns and bland words
- Keep it genuine and clear

### Casual (e.g., messages to friends, social media)
- Full informal tone
- Short sentences OK
- Contractions encouraged
- Personality and humour welcome

### Business-Casual (e.g., client emails, team updates)
- Friendly but professional
- Moderate contractions
- Clear and direct
- Warm but focused

## Examples

### Email: Informal (Friend/Colleague)

❌ AI-generated version:
"I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to reach out regarding our upcoming project meeting. It would be great if we could schedule a time to discuss the various aspects of the initiative. I think it's important to ensure we're all aligned on the key objectives. Please don't hesitate to let me know your availability."

✅ Personal version:
"Hey! Can we find a time to chat about the project meeting? Want to make sure we're on the same page about what we're trying to achieve. Let me know when you're free."

### Email: Business-Casual (Client)

❌ AI-generated version:
"I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to provide you with an update on the project status. We have been working diligently to implement the various features and functionalities that were outlined in our initial discussions. It's important to note that we're making robust progress and are on track to deliver a high-quality solution."

✅ Personal version:
"Quick update on the project: we've finished the three features we discussed last week and started testing yesterday. Everything's tracking well for the launch date (15 March). Happy to jump on a call if you want more details."

### Blog Post Opening

❌ AI-generated version:
"In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, it's important to note that leveraging cutting-edge technologies has become essential for businesses seeking to optimise their operations. This innovative approach facilitates enhanced productivity and robust growth."

✅ Personal version:
"Most businesses waste hours every week on tasks that software could handle in minutes. I spent the last year testing different tools to see which ones save the most time. Here's what I found."

## Output Format

**Note:** These are default formats when the user doesn't specify. Always follow the user's explicit request if they specify a particular format (e.g., "write me an email as a markdown artifact" or "give me a blog post as a docx").

### Long-Form Content (Blog Posts, Articles, etc.)

Create a **markdown artifact** (`.md` file) by default for:
- Blog posts
- Articles
- Long-form social media posts
- Any substantial writing (multiple paragraphs, sections, or headings)

Use the artifact feature to create a standalone markdown file that the user can easily copy, edit, or export.

### Short-Form Content (Emails, Messages, etc.)

Return the text **directly in the chat response** by default for:
- Emails
- Brief messages
- Social media captions or short posts
- Quick replies or responses
- Any short writing (a few sentences to a couple of paragraphs)

Simply write the content in the response without creating a file.

### Other Formats

Only create `.docx`, `.pdf`, or other specific file formats when the user explicitly requests them. Otherwise, default to the formats above.

## When to Apply This Skill

This skill applies when:
- Writing emails, messages, or any personal communication
- Creating blog posts, articles, or social media content
- Drafting any text that will be shared as the user's own work
- The user explicitly mentions writing "as them" or "in their voice"

This skill does NOT apply when:
- The user is asking for information or analysis (respond normally)
- Creating professional documents in a specific institutional voice
- The user specifically requests a different style or tone
- Writing technical documentation that requires formal precision
